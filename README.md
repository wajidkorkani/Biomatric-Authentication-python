# Biometric Authentication — Python

A small Flask-based demo that demonstrates biometric (face) authentication for user login and registration.

This repository contains a lightweight example app that shows how to register users and authenticate them using face scans. It's intended as a learning/demo project rather than a production-ready solution.

## Features
- User registration and login (HTML forms provided in `Src/instance/Templates`)
- Example Flask app entry point: `Src/app.py`

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer
- pip
- (Optional) A virtual environment tool such as `venv` or `virtualenv`

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository and change into the project directory:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\Zem\Coding\Flask\Biomatric-Authentication-python
```

2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3. Install dependencies (if a `requirements.txt` exists) or add the ones you need:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the app:

```powershell
python Src\app.py
```

5. Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or the address shown in the terminal) and try the registration/login pages.

## Notes and next steps
- This project is a demo. For production usage consider security best practices (HTTPS, secure credential storage, CSRF protection, input validation).
- If you want face recognition functionality, integrate a library such as `face_recognition` (dlib + face_recognition) or use a cloud face recognition API. Add the required dependencies to `requirements.txt` and update `Src/app.py` accordingly.

If you'd like, I can also:

- Add a `requirements.txt` with common dependencies (Flask, Pillow, face_recognition stub)
- Improve `Src/app.py` to include a simple example flow for storing and verifying a face encoding
- Add basic README badges and contribution notes
